30 Days of D3
=============

Creating data visualizations with D3 has long been on my bucket list. So, I started learning D3 and kept going for 30 days. Each day, I tried to build something from what I learned. Below is my progression in the form of completed projects.


Check out my first few projects at [Codepen](http://codepen.io/collection/AOENPY/)

- [Project 1 - Bar Chart](http://codepen.io/tommyt/pen/QEwzWz)
- [Project 2 - SVG Circles](http://codepen.io/tommyt/pen/WxbLRm)
- [Project 3 - SVG Bar Chart](http://codepen.io/tommyt/pen/jrPqKy)
- [Project 4 - Simple Scatterplot](http://codepen.io/tommyt/pen/RRPxYy)
- [Project 5 - Scatterplot and Axes](http://codepen.io/tommyt/pen/jrPRPe)

Unfortunately, the non-Pro version of Codepen does not give you a way to load assets, like JSON files. The follow projects instead are currently run locally.

- [Project 6 - A Map](http://codepen.io/tommyt/pen/pbJBJq)
  - Use [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server), [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson), and [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/)
